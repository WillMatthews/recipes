    \item Soften butter (microwace for 10 seconds, or leave out for 30 minutes).
    \item Crush chocolate (I use a hammer and the packaging it comes in, but a rolling pin and a bowl works too).
    \item Preheat fan oven to 170\textdegree C.
    \item Add butter to bowl with sugars. Mix well until creamy.
    \item Add vanilla extract and egg. Beat well.
    \item Add flour, bicarbonate of soda and salt. Mix well.
    \item Add chocolate and mix well.
    \item Place generous teaspoonfuls of the mixture onto a baking tray, and bake for 15 minutes.
    \item If cookies are still very soft after 15 minutes, leave in the oven until brown on the edges yet still slightly soft in the middle.
    \item Leave to cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

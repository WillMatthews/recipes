    \item Pack spinach into a glass bowl, pour on boiling water and allow spinach to wilt. Depress using wooden spoon to submerge. Stir and leave for 1 minute. Drain spinach in colander and cool with cold water, squeeze with hands to wring out water. Roughly chop and set aside.
    \item Fry shallot, spring onion and garlic, stirring often, over high heat until softened and starting to brown. Lower heat, add spinach and fry for 1 minute to finish drying. Season with nutmeg and leave to cool.
    \item Mix oil with dill, lightly oil a cake tin. Lightly oil a pastry sheet, and place such that it covers the base of the tin, and overhangs two of the sides in a corner. Mirror this process and repeat three more times. 
    \item In a fresh bowl, mix ricotta, beaten egg, dill, chives and mint. Season with pepper and salt. Stir this mixture with the spinach, and crumble in the feta. Place this mixture into your cake tin, and fold over the overhanging pastry.
    \item Lightly oil and place final pastry sheet on top. Place in oven and bake for 35 minutes until pastry is golden. Cool for 10 minutes.
